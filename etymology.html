<h1>ETYMOLOGY</h1>
<img src="images/eee.png" alt="an image for etymology page" width="60%">
<p>In 1911, the government of Taiwan appointed Cai Yuanpei, the president of the Education Ministry, 
	to set up the Pronunciation Unification Association in order to promote the Mandarin campaign, 
	and Wu Zhi Hui was the chairman of the association to make preparations for it. 
	The association began to design and arrange phonetic symbols 
	by referring to the Japanese Pinyin system in the hope of unifying the pronunciation of sounds. 
	Beginning with the three components of consonants, vowels, rhymes, and mediators,
	simple and easy-to-understand symbols were selected to serve as the basis of pinyin. 
	The "phonetic alphabet" was also promulgated, and was gradually deleted 
	and reduced according to the usage situation to the familiar "ㄅㄆㄇㄈ" order 
	and "一聲" and "二聲" tones for pronunciation.
	<br><br>
	The earliest phonetic symbols known as phonetic alphabets were designed 
	by Zhang Taiyan in the late Qing Dynasty according to the seal script, to improve the shortcomings 
	of Chinese characters without phonetic support. The "Cheyenne Character Movement", 
	which was promoted among the public between 1892 and 1911, was very difficult to learn because it 
	was necessary to know the pronunciation of a Chinese character first and then to extrapolate from the 
	character backward or use the inverse method of cutting to know the pronunciation structure of the character. 
	Since then, two well-known schools of thought have emerged: the Latin school promoted by Lu Dongzhang and the 
	kana school founded by Zhang Taiyan, both of which aim to assist in the understanding of pronunciation and 
	systematic integration, and each of which has its supporters.</p>
