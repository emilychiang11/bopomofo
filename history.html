<h1>HISTORY</h1>

<h2>From 1912 to 1913, Wu Zhihui led the Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation, 
	which developed a method known as Zhuyin Zimu, based on Zhang Binglin's shorthand. 
	It served as the official phonetic script for annotating the sounds of the 
	characters using the Old National Pronunciation. The Republic of China National 
	Ministry of Education produced a draft on July 11, 1913, but it wasn't officially 
	announced until November 23, 1928. The Guóyīn Zìmǔ 'national pronunciation alphabet' 
	was renamed Zhùyīn Fúhào 'phonetic symbols' in April 1930 to prevent the alphabet from 
	replacing Chinese characters on its own.
	<br><br>
	. In 1912, the Ministry of Education of Taiwan convened the Provisional Education Conference and passed the "Adoption of the Phonetic Alphabet".
	<br>
	. In 1913, the Ministry of Education convened the Pronunciation Unification Conference and formally formulated the phonetic alphabet.
	<br>
	. In 1918, the Ministry of Education of the Beiyang Government issued the "phonetic alphabet".
	<br>
	. In 1930, the phonetic alphabet was renamed "phonetic symbols".
	<br>
	. 1958, discontinued after the implementation of the Hanyu Pinyin Program in mainland China, and retained only in major Hanyu dictionaries and toolkits.
