<h1>ETYMOLOGY</h1>
<img src="images/eee.png" width="60%">
<h2>The name Bopomofo comes from the first four letters of the system: ㄅ, ㄆ, ㄇ and ㄈ.
	Similar to the way that the word "alphabet" is ultimately derived from the names of 
	the first two letters of the alphabet (alpha and beta),the name "Bopomofo" is derived 
	from the first four syllables in the conventional ordering of available syllables 
	in Mandarin Chinese. The four Bopomofo characters (ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) that correspond to these 
	syllables are usually placed first in a list of these characters. The same sequence 
	is sometimes used by other speakers of Chinese to refer to other phonetic systems.
	<br><br>
	In 1911, the government of Taiwan appointed Cai Yuanpei, the president of the Education Ministry, 
	to set up the Pronunciation Unification Association in order to promote the Mandarin campaign, 
	and Wu Zhi Hui was the chairman of the association to make preparations for it. 
	The association began to design and arrange phonetic symbols 
	by referring to the Japanese Pinyin system in the hope of unifying the pronunciation of sounds. 
	Beginning with the three components of consonants, vowels, rhymes, and mediators,
	simple and easy-to-understand symbols were selected to serve as the basis of pinyin. 
	The "phonetic alphabet" was also promulgated, and was gradually deleted 
	and reduced according to the usage situation to the familiar "ㄅㄆㄇㄈ" order 
	and "一聲" and "二聲" tones for pronunciation.</h2>
