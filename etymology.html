<h1>ETYMOLOGY</h1>
<h2><img src="images/et.jpeg" width="40%"></h2>
<h3>The name Bopomofo comes from the first four letters of the system: ㄅ, ㄆ, ㄇ and ㄈ.
	Similar to the way that the word "alphabet" is ultimately derived from the names of 
	the first two letters of the alphabet (alpha and beta),the name "Bopomofo" is derived 
	from the first four syllables in the conventional ordering of available syllables 
	in Mandarin Chinese. The four Bopomofo characters (ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) that correspond to these 
	syllables are usually placed first in a list of these characters. The same sequence 
	is sometimes used by other speakers of Chinese to refer to other phonetic systems.</h3>
